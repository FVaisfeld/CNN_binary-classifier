The example contains a ResNet-CNN model for the classification of pictures of apples and bananas. The whole training process is depicted in the notebook file. 
Furthermore the back-end can be run with the front-end interfact of streamlit, there is a tracking of prediction realized trough a logfile and the whole application can be dockerized into a container. 


For trying out please install requirements, run the notebook file for training the model, and then run the shell script for starting a streamlit session.
